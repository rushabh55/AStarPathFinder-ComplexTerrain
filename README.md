TerrainPathfinder
=================
This is a demo that compares the performance of A* and BFS. Given a complex terrain with a predefined end point, we can choose one of the two algorithms and compare the paths taken by the character in the scene

How to use:
1. Choose between A* and BFS out of the UI on the left side of the screen.
2. If you wish to compare the path taken by the other algorithm, refresh the window and choose the other path finding algorithm. 

Improvements:
1. Make it a procedural terrain. We aren't using any of the heightmap information currently, however I would like to use the terrain engine's heightmap to make a truly random terrain, and apply the algorithm on that. 
2. Allow the user to place the endpoint. 
3. Improve the camera follow algorithm.
